        Green Tree Boas or Emerald Tree Boas are more advanced reptile pets than something like a Crested Gecko or Leopard Gecko.
        They are quite large, some growing to lengths of 7 feet full grown, meaning they require alot of space to be housed.
        If you know anything about taking care of reptiles, the larger the enclousure the harder to maintain as you need to be extremely conscious
        of the temperature, humidity, and cleanliness of a larger space. They do require pretty high heat compared to other snakes especially for their
        basking spots. In addition to this you'll have to house rodents and other live food for your Boa as snakes typically hunt at night and therefore use
        their infared sensory dips to locate moving food through heat. Luckly they should only be fed once every three weeks to keep them healthy.
        They will almost never eat long dead frozen animals. This also means to be extremely cafreful if you are to handle your Boa at night,
        as to them your hand might look like a meal, and Emerald Tree Boas have large teeth. Emerald Tree Boas are arborial and therefore require alot of vertical space.
        However, they are also very active at night and would need some horizontal area to move. The more plants the better,
        and it is actually recommended to keep these Boas in bioactive enclousres.
        Be sure to always do more of your own research instead of reading this homework assignment.
