        Leopard Geckos are fairly easy to care for and are a great beginner reptile pet for anyone.
        They are desert dwellers and therefore perfer dry desert like habitats for their terrarium. The terrarium itself should not be tall,
        but rather wide to allow for more horizontal exploration. Leopard geckos are not arborial so they do not do much horizontal climbing.
        However, there should be different elevations especially some sort of high basking spot under the heat lamp. Reptiles are cold blooded,
        and therefore bask in heat to regulate their body temperature. A UVA lamp is also required to replicate the UV rays of the sun which helps
        the leopard gecko with shedding and digestion. If you are not looking to make a bioactive enclosure, the best substrate for your leopard gecko's habitat is tile,
        woord, or paper towel. Loose substrate can cause impaction in the digestive track if too much is consumed, and reptile carpet is absolutely
        horrible the the gecko's claws, and has a good chance to soon house alot of bacteria which can cause infection. The recommended substrate is also easy to clean
        compared to loose substrate or reptile carpet. Leopard geckos are fully carnivorous and will only eat insects such as crickets and meal worms.
        Be sure to coat the insects in calcium powder to provide your leopard gecko with a good amount of calcium to help its digestion.
        Be sure to always do more of your own research instead of reading this homework assignment.
