        Crested Geckos are one of the best beginner reptile pets to own. They are extremely easy to care for as they do not have as many demanding requirements
        as other repitles do. For one, if your room is warm enough they do not need a heat lamp to produce heat.
        A UV or UVA lamp is recommended but also not a hard requirment. In terms of food there is premade supplement powder that you can buy and mix with water,
        that your crestie will enjoy very much. You may also feed them crickets and meal worms as a snack. Cresites are arborial and therefore do require a tall terrarium
        with alot of climbing spaces. Make sure to keep their food and water dishes above the ground as Cresties rarely will reach ground level.
        Include lots of plants and clean wooden bark for your crestie to hide away as they like to hide when they sleep to feel safe.
        Crested geckos are also a great pet to keep in a bioactive enclousure which will significantly limit how often the terrarium needs to be cleaned.
        If you'd like to handle your crestie make sure to take things slow and one step at a time so they an get used to you. Taming them does take time but eventaully
        they will feel extremely comfortable around you. Be sure to always do more of your own research instead of reading this homework assignment.
